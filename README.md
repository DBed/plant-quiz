**Plant Keeper - An exercise in educational Botany!**

**What is it?**
This app was originally designed as a water tracker but eventually shifted into an educational tool and conjoined quiz.  

**How does it work?**
The different plant views are handled using javascript to alter the CSS stylings and html output. 
The quiz is handled with javascript functions that check each input value and increase the score accordingly, the score affects the final output message.

**What's next?**

 Better responsiveness!  
 - I made the app in the early days of my HTML/JS experience, there's quite a bit of work to be done refining the non-fullscreen views
 
 More robust information
 - I'd like to incorporate API's to populate a lot more information tiles, this might require a change of topic or re-write as there isn't much out there for plant data.
